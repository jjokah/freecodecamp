    <h1>Veritasium</h1>
    <p>Veritasium is a channel of science and engineering videos featuring experiments, expert interviews, cool demos, and discussions with the public about everything science. Here are 3 of his videos on Psychology:</p>

        <h2>Game Theory</h2>
        <p>
            The video explains the Prisoner's Dilemma, a scenario where individual rational choices lead to a less optimal outcome for all involved, using the example of a nuclear arms race. However, in repeated interactions, cooperation can emerge, as demonstrated by Impalas grooming each other. Political scientist Robert Axelrod's computer tournaments showed that the simple "Tit for Tat" strategy, which starts with cooperation and mirrors the opponent's previous move, was surprisingly successful. Key qualities of successful strategies include being nice, forgiving, retaliatory, and clear. The video also touches on how "noise" can affect cooperation and concludes that cooperation often pays off in the long run across various aspects of life.

        <h2>Number 37</h2>
        <p>
            The video explores why many people choose the number 37 when asked to pick a random number between 1 and 100. Surveys show 37 and 73 are frequently chosen, challenging randomness. The video highlights the significance of odd numbers, primes, and 37's mathematical properties, discussing its practical importance in decision-making, like the "37% rule". It also shows how often 37 appears in everyday life.

        <h2>Democracy</h2>
        <p>
This video explores the mathematical impossibilities of democracy, particularly in the methods used to elect leaders. It discusses various voting systems, including "first past the post", instant runoff, and ranked-choice voting, highlighting their flaws and potential for irrational outcomes. The video references Arrow's impossibility theorem, which states that no ranked voting system with three or more candidates can satisfy a set of reasonable conditions. It also touches on alternative voting systems like approval voting and the importance of political engagement despite the imperfections in democratic processes.
